# SimCLRPytorch
Usage of mixed techniques, including unsupervised representation learning, aiming at getting similar results to SimCLR model with lower time and batch requirements. Based on several papers including  [Leveraging Random Label Memorization for Unsupervised Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01640.pdf) and [Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05709.pdf)
